Visualizer

This is my final project from RPI's Computer Graphics course.

The project's guidelines were to create some sort of interactive 3D program using OpenGL.

This program takes an mp3 and converts it to a Fast Fourier Transform in real time. It can act either as a conventional visualizer and display in 2d, or travel along the z axis, leaving behind previous transforms to create a 3d "landscape" of the song.
